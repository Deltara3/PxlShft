# PxlShft
A programming oriented, pixel font complete with ligatures.

## Status
- [ ] Complete the character set on a standard US keyboard.
- [ ] Programming ligatures for readability.

## Contributing
Unimplemented characters are greatly appreciated, I'm only one person and I can't do them all by myself. Just make sure they fit the style. Each character width is typically five em. Use other characters as a guideline.

- Clone this repository.
- Open the `source` folder in FontForge.
- Make any modifications or additions if desired.
- Head to File and click Generate Fonts, it will ask you where to save it.
